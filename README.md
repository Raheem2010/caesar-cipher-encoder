# caesar-cipher-encoder
A Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher featuring both basic and advanced modes. Supports encryption, decryption, uppercase characters, punctuation, and clean wrap-around logic. Demonstrates fundamental string manipulation and classical cryptography concepts.

🚀 Features

Encrypt and decrypt text

Supports uppercase and lowercase letters

Leaves punctuation, spaces, numbers unchanged

Adjustable offset (1–26+)

Wrap-around alphabet handling

Clean and easy-to-read code

📚 How It Works

Each alphabetic character is shifted using the provided offset

Lowercase and uppercase are handled separately

Characters outside A–Z/a–z remain unchanged

Wrap-around ensures shifting past "z" begins again at "a"
